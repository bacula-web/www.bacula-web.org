Starting today, previous documentation is not available anymore.

<!-- truncate -->

As mentioned in a [previous blog post](https://www.bacula-web.org/blog/website-update-in-progress), the website and documentation have moved to https://www.bacula-web.org.

I've spent a good amount of time moving all content from the old documentation (https://docs.bacula-web.org), and it's now time to say "goodbye" to the old documentation.
For this reason, previous documentation, which was available through https://docs.bacula-web.org will not be available anymore as of today.

:::info

Browsing old documentation will automatically redirect to https://www.bacula-web.org/docs
